Rinchinnyamyn Amarjargal, who was appointed prime minister on July 30, 1999, is forced to unite right-wing forces as a leader to prepare for elections in Mongolia's parliament just over a year away. But is it an easy thing to do? Amarjargal was originally a figure who didn't have to be prime minister. After the collapse of the communist proletarian dictatorship that dominated Mongolia for decades, the legendary Mongolian pro-democracy activist Sanjaasürengiin Zorig was the most reasonable alternative to rallying Mongolia's anti-communist democratic factions in the 1990s. During the unprecedented Mongolian economic crisis, politicians agreed to appoint Zorig as Mongolia's prime minister on 5th October 1998. But tragedy has come. On 2nd October 1998, when an unidentified assassin assassinated Zorig, Mongolian right-wing forces lost their center at once. Mongolia had to find a new leader, as Zorig died three days before his term as prime minister began. The new alternative was the Mayor of Ulaanbaatar Janlavyn Narantsatsralt. However, Narantsatsralt resigned after a short term due to a confrontation with the opposition Mongolian People's Party, and the economist Amarjargal became the new prime minister.\n\nWith just a few months to go before the general election, the task given to Amarjargal is too heavy. Because of the economic crisis, the public's approval rating for the right-wing ruling party is not that great. The socialist party MPRP is rallying public support, blaming the ruling party for failing to solve economic problems. but Amarjargal doesn't seem to have the right charisma to rally public support in this election..."

The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) was a rulling party in Mongolia from the 1920s until 1990. During the Cold War, the MPRP forcibly ruled Mongolia with the support of the Soviet Union, which destroyed many of Mongolia's Buddhist culture. However, after the Mongolian Democratic Revolution in 1990, MPRP's influence in Mongolian politics decreased. MPRP abandoned Marxism and chose democratic socialism as its official ideology.\n\nThe opposition to the MPRP is the Democratic Union Coalition. The DUC is technically a 'political coalition' not a political party. It is a coalition of conservatives from Mongolian National Democratic Party and the social democrats from Mongolian Social Democratic Party. The DUC succeeded in becoming Mongolia's ruling party after the Mongolian Revolution, but the Big Tent coalition is showing signs of division.\n\nLastly, rumors are circulating that Oyunn, the sister of Zorig, a legendary Mongolian pro-democracy activist, is preparing for a new party. She is planning a party named the Civil Will Party and wants to unite Mongolia's liberal forces in the 2000 election."

 mongolia.introgame.3.desc:0 "Mongolia has the worst geographical conditions. It is difficult to export goods because there is no sea, and the entire border is surrounded by two countries, Russia and China. Unless two countries, Russia and China, open their borders, Mongolia cannot import any goods or export any goods. That's why Mongolia has a lot of underground resources, but China and Russia can buy them from Mongolia for less than its original value.\n\nIt is important for Mongolia to maintain a balance between the two countries, Russia and China. However, one of them will eventually become Mongolia's more important economic partner. China is expected to become a more important partner if the MPRP comes to power, but some politicians think that Russia can be an alternative to China."

Zorig was the hero of the Mongols, who liberated the country from communist dictatorship. In 1998, he was assassinated, but his sister, Sanjaasürengiin Oyuun, decided to run in the election today to succeed Zorig's will.

Although there is no evidence, many Zorig's supporters believed that socialists were behind his assassination. because they were the only political force that could benefit from his assassination. Some hardliners inside the DUC have suggested that they declare a major reinvestigation of the Zorig case to wreak havoc on the MPRP in the election, although they are not capable of obtaining hard evidence.\n\nThe 2000 election is expected to focus on \"economic\" issues. But if the reinvestigation of Zorig's assassination and investigation of MPRP members were launched, the mood of the election would be completely different. "

Today, some of [FROM.GetAdjective] diplomats have been taking secret approaches to government politicians. They say they have evidence of MPRP involvement in Zorig's assassination. Although this evidence was provided by foreigners, it is possible that it was fabricated. But if we re-investigate the Zorig assassination at their suggestion, it could hurt MPRP greatly.\n\nThe 2000 election is expected to focus on \"economic\" issues.

The investigation team announced the conclusion on the eve of the election that the MPRP was likely involved in the Zorig assassination, and many members of the public began to feel confused about the outcome of the reinvestigation.

The most appropriate target was Taiwan, their traditional rival to the mainland China. Today, [MON.GetLeader] and [MON.GetLeader.GetHerHim] entourage had a formal meeting with [CHI.GetLeader] in Taipei. The most important political topic was the diplomatic cooperation of the two countries. By old law, the whole of Mongolia was set up as a de jure territory in Taiwan. [CHI.GetLeader] said [CHI.GetLeader.GetSheHe] would delete this clause as soon as possible, saying, 'It is nonsense that Mongolia is part of Taiwan.'\n\nSince mainland China separates Mongolia and Taiwan, a trade agreement between the two countries is expected to be difficult.

The talks were short, but they came to the conclusion that Mongolia and Japan need to maintain more 'close' relations.\n\nThrough the talks, Japan promised more economic investment in Mongolia, and Mongolia released a formal statement supporting the sovereignty of Japan's Senkaku, Takeshima (Korean Name 'Dokdo'), and Chishima Islands (Russian Name 'Kuril').

 MON_mongolian_2000_election_cat_desc:0 "The year 2000 is the year of Mongolia's general elections. DUC has already completely lost popularity with Mongolian people due to the political incompetence of the 1990s. Because citizens already despise DUC, any campaign in this election will not make it possible for they to succeed in regaining power.\n\nBut at least there may be a way to stop the establishment of a socialist government of the MPRP. The way is to re-investigate the assassination of Zorig, Mongolia's national hero. While many people suspect that the MPRP was behind the assassination of Zorig, there is no direct evidence that the MPRP was involved in this. Because there is no evidence, this may not be judged as the right political action, but if it can deepen suspicions about MPRP in the people... the outcome of the election could be different."

Experts suggest interfere in elections using the case of Zorig, who was assassinated in Mongolia two years ago.\n\nMany Mongolian citizens believe that the MPRP may have intervened in the assassination of Zorig. If we provide the Mongolian government with fake information that the MPRP actually intervened in the assassination, they can use this information to conduct a re-investigation of the Zorig assassination. This will completely reverse the political situation in Mongolia right before the election."
