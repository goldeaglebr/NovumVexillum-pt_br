 miscFlavor.1.d:0"Air France Flight 4590 was an international charter flight of Air France, from Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris, to John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York. On the afternoon of Tuesday, 25 July 2000, at 16:44:31 local time, the aircraft serving the flight ran over debris on the runway during takeoff, blowing a tyre, which threw chunks of tyre into the landing gear and the underside of the left wing, rupturing the fuel tank.\n The aircraft, impossible to control, then crashed into a hotel in nearby Gonesse two minutes after takeoff. All 109 people on board were killed, alongside four in the hotel.\nUntil the crash, Concorde had been considered among the world's safest aeroplanes. The crash was a direct cause of the end of the aircraft's career..."
