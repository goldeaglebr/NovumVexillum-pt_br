 RAJ_pale_southern_tiger:0 "The Pale Tiger"
 RAJ_pale_southern_tiger_desc:0 "India is a democratic country. At least institutionally. But there is still political violence, numerous assassinations and terrorism. Since independence in 1947, India's democracy has never functioned properly. Political corruption is deeply ingrained, from central politics to local officials, and the path for non-corrupt political parties and interest groups to make their own voices heard is blocked.\n\nIndia is the reigning South Asian tiger, but their democracy remains pale. Corruption and terrorism, religious violence between Hinduism and Islam, abuse of women, and caste-based discrimination against status have blocked the path for India's democracy to develop for half one century..."

 POLITICS_lok_sabha_DESC: "India's two major political parties, the INS and the BJP, are competing in parliament. Since neither party has gathered enough lawmakers to form a cabinet, the two parties are discussing building a coalition government with minor parties."
 POLITICS_naxalite_junta_DESC: "Naxalites, an Indian Maoist rebel group, has ruled many parts of India militarily since the 1960s. The Indian government and local Naxalites warlords have been in dispute for decades, but Maoists still rule many parts of India."
 POLITICS_atal_b_vajpayee_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 25th December 1924, in Gwalior, Gwalior State, British India\n§YPolitical Career:§! Vajpayee, a hard-right Hindu politician, is also the founder of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a Hindu nationalist party in India. He strived to unite the divided India into the Hindu spirit and transform it into a powerful, united state during the 20th century. His political efforts made it possible for him to serve as India's prime minister in 1996, and 1998.\n\nOf course, not everyone likes his hard-line nationalist policies. His 1998 nuclear test almost led India to international isolation, and he sought to empower Hinduism rather than bring India's many religious people to peace.\n\nBut at least he is trying to create a united India as a powerful nation, with a united religion. It is not yet known whether his efforts will unify the Indian identity or, conversely, deepen the divide."
 POLITICS_sonia_gandhi_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 9th December 1946, in Lusiana, Veneto, Italian Republic\n§YPolitical Career:§! An Italian, married to her Indian husband Rajiv Gandhi, she had no plans for politics. She was not interested in politics, she just wanted to have a quiet life with her family. However, she became involved in politics through the assassination of her family. Her mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi, and her husband, Rajiv Gandhi, were both assassinated. A severe Indian split violently changed Indian politics, and she decided to become a politician to change India.\n\n Democracy in India is not complete. Hindu nationalism and religious fundamentalism can never unite India. She is ready to reform India against the violence and corruption that dominate the country. Even if it is difficult and faces many objections."
