 argentina.1.t:0 "Dealing with the Crisis"
 argentina.1.d:0 "Due to the economic crisis ravaging the nation, many Argentines, fearing an economic crash and possibly a devaluation, are transforming pesos to dollars and withdrawing them from the banks in large amounts, usually transferring them to foreign accounts, worsening the crisis. \n\nIn order to stop this draining from destroying the banking system, our economy minister is suggesting we freeze all bank accounts and only allow a small amount of money to be withdrawn per person weekly and only in pesos. \n\nHowever, other government members fear that this measure could worsen the political and social crisis caused by the recession."
 argentina.1.a:0 "We have no other options."
 argentina.1.b:0 "It is too risky"

 argentina.2.t:0 "Argentinazo!"
 argentina.2.d:0 "The people, tired of the economic crisis, and angry about our recent economic measures, have taken to the streets in anger. \n\nProtests and riots are being reported all over the nation, with violence being reported from both police and protesters. As the death toll continues rising, the nation awaits the reaction from the presidency."
 argentina.2.a:0 "We must declare a state of emergency."
 argentina.2.b:0 "Backtrack our reforms and make concessions to the protesters."
 argentina.3.t:0 "[ARG.GetLeader] Resigns!"
 argentina.3.d:0 "Following the increasing unrest, the rising death toll, and the loss of his own party's support, [ARG.GetLeader] has announced his resignation as president of the Argentine Republic, with an iconic photograph being taken of him fleeing in a helicopter. Federico Ramón Puerta will take over as president until Congress elects a new interim president. \n\nThis event has weakened the Unión Cívica Radical, and the Partido Justicialista has taken the chance to strengthen themselves. It is unlikely for the UCR to be elected shortly."
