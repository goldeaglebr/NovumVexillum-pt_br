  european_union.1.t:0 "[From.GetName] wants to join the EU"
 european_union.1.d:0 "Diplomats from [From.GetName] have applied to join the European Union. Should a single member state - let's say our delegation - veto their application, they will not be permitted. We need to make a wise choice."
 european_union.1.o1:0 "We approve."
 european_union.1.o2:0 "Veto!"
 european_union.2.t:0 "We have been vetoed!"
 european_union.2.d:0 "At least one EU member state has rejected our application. Thus, our EU membership is just wishful thinking now."
 european_union.2.o1:0 "It was worth the try."
 european_union.3.t:0 "Unite the Union!"
 european_union.3.d:0 "It is time. All paperwork has been done, all treaties are on the table. We can now send invitations to all EU member states to form one big, glorious and invincible Federation."
 european_union.3.o1:0 "This is Europe's finest hour!"
 european_union.4.t:0 "Call to join the EU Federalization"
 european_union.4.d:0 "The European Union in the past has done everything to drive its member states closer to each other. It guaranteed us peace, economic prosperity and greater freedom for our citizens. But now, the EU is asking us to do the next step: One of the countries has initiated the process to Unite the EU."
 european_union.4.o1:0 "In varietate concordia!"
 european_union.4.o2:0 "Give up our sovereignity? Rather not."
 european_union.5.t:0 "Invitation to the European Union"
 european_union.5.d:0 "Due to recent bureaucratic reforms within the European Union, it now views us as a valid partner. One of the major European powers has called for us to join the economic alliance. Our people are split on the issue and our decision could go either way."
 european_union.5.o1:0 "In varietate concordia!"
 european_union.5.o2:0 "This is not our goal right now."
 european_union.6.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Investments"
 european_union.6.d:0 "The deal behind the European Union is simple: Larger European economies help the smaller ones develop and, in exchange, gain a larger market and a greater amount of possible consumers. Industralists from [From.GetName] have visited [Root.GetAdjective] facilities today and have made agreements to improve our political and economic infrastructure."
 european_union.6.o1:0 "All help is welcome."
 european_union.7.t:0 "[Root.GetName] joins the European Union"
 european_union.7.d:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] delegation has, after months and years of preparation and several negotiation streaks, finally taken its place in the European Parliament. [Root.GetName] has joined the European Union."
 european_union.7.o1:0 "Huzzah!"
 european_union.7.o2:0 "Alright then."
 european_union.8.t:0 "[From.GetName] rejects the EU invitation"
 european_union.8.d:0 "After months and months of attempted agreements and failed negotiations, the government of [From.GetName] has ultimately rejected the proposal to join the European Union. Our ways are meant to stay divided for now."
 european_union.8.o1:0 "It would have been nice to have them."
 european_union.10.t:0 "Abandoning the EU"
 european_union.10.d1:0 "The European Union is just an oppressive force. The officials in Brussels have now asked our delegation to leave their so-called 'holy halls' after one of our delegates requested a picture of Adolf Hitler to be hung up behind the speaker's podium. This probably is the beginning of the end of our EU membership - which is likely for the best, as that saves us the paperwork to quit by ourselves."
 european_union.10.d2:0 "The European Union holds us and our fellow sovereign European states back from greatness. The members of our government grow increasingly upset with the European attitude towards our national sovereignity and the ease with which European delegates do whatever the United States tells them to do.\n\nWe need to quit. This is unacceptable. They can kiss American asses all they want, but they will have to do that without us."
 european_union.10.d3:0 "While monarchies are not technically banned from joining the European Union, they have to have petty little things like parliaments or elections - which the grand system around [This.GetLeader] thankfully is devoid of. This however has lead to a precarious spot for us, being asked to either hold general elections within the next week or be expelled from the halls.\n\nWell, we won't hold elections, that much is certain, so it seems they will have to play their little 'democracy' game without us."
 european_union.10.d4:0 "With a right-wing political party now in power, the democratic character and economic benefit of the European Union has been increasingly called into question.\n\nThe [This.GetRulingParty] delegates are split on the issue: The ideological hardliners want to leave the union no matter the consequences, while the economically liberal faction points to the number of jobs created by the EU and the political stability it brings to the continent.\n\nAny decision will be controversial, as the populous is split on the issue. Will the EU carry on without us - or should we stay?"
 european_union.10.d5:0 "The European Union is nothing but a bunch of capitalists that try to conquer the world for capitalism. Our brave [This.GetAdjective] delegates have stood up for the working people in every session they attended, but they are outvoted on almost any issue - when asking to disown the super rich across Europe, the delegation was even kicked from the hall! Well, maybe they should not have attacked three other delegations while their speaker was trying to argue with them, but still!\n\nThis is completely unacceptable. We can no longer carry this farce of a conglomerate. Without us!"
 european_union.10.d6:0 "Even [This.GetLeader] has remarked that the European Union is really 'nothing but a bunch of infidels' when talking to a conservative islamic newspaper last week. Because of this, calls to leave the EU have gotten louder the country over - and inside the European Union. 'If you don't respect our holy halls, leave!', the president of the European Parliament shouted at our delegation today. After one of our delegates remarked that there is nothing holy except for Allah, he was kicked from the hall.\n\nThe EU has run its course for our nation. We are thankful for their cooperation, but their hedonism and worldly intrigue is unacceptable. They will have to play their stupid games without us."
 european_union.10.o1:0 "Without us indeed."
 european_union.10.o2:0 "Maybe we should stay after all."
 european_union.15.t:0 "The End of the European Union"
 european_union.15.d:0 "The EU has fallen. The institutions in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg have been abandoned indefinitely and the politicians once representing their nations in the European Parliament have been sent home and told to help their people in their own countries again."
 european_union.15.o1:0 "Everything comes to an end."
 european_union.16.t:0 "The Euro"
 european_union.16.d:0 "Plans for a common European currency have been around since the foundation of the European Union in 1992.\nThe project comes to fruition ten years later, with the creation of the Euro, guided by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nGiving up national authority over our currency might have downsides, but the economic benefits of trading with our neighbors and partners might just outweigh them.\nBritish, Danish and Swedish delegations have already voiced concerns and demanded a possibility of an opt-out for their respective country; which is why they refused to participate in the initial digital introduction of the Euro in 1999. What should our policy be?"
 european_union.16.o1:0 "An excellent proposal!"
 european_union.16.o2:0 "We want an opt-out."
 european_union.17.t:0 "Re-Nationalize the Currency"
 european_union.17.d:0 "Now that we are no longer involved with the Eurozone, we have - as expected - been informed by the European Central Bank that we need to soon shift the Euro out of use in our country.\n\nIntroducing a new national currency will take quite a bit of political effort - but it has to be done."
 european_union.17.o1:0 "Let's get it over with."
 european_union.18.t:0 "Call EU military aid?"
 european_union.18.d:0 "We are under attack by a foreign power. As according to the EU article 42.7 - the 'mutual defense clause' - we are entitled to military assistance from all other European Union members. Should we invoke the article to call our friends to our side?"
 european_union.18.o1:0 "Call the EU to our side!"
 european_union.18.o2:0 "We don't need them."
 european_union.19.t:0 "[From.GetName] is in need of assistance!"
 european_union.19.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] has invoked EU article 42.7 due to the recent [From.From.GetAdjective] attack, under which all European Union members are required to come to each other's aid in the terms of military attack by a foreign force.\n\nThere is no doubt that we need to join our allies as according to the treaties we signed - but should we?"
 european_union.19.o1:0 "European now, European forever!"
 european_union.19.o2:0 "Uhhhh... how about we don't?"
